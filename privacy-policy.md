PRIVACY POLICY
---------------
                                   
The Vigilcybre app and Shyamala Pandey take your privacy very seriously. Beyond the information Apple provides to developers that the user (will be referred to as "you" and "your") can decide to provide, the Vigilcybre app uses no third-party analytics or advertising frameworks. Shyamala Pandey (will be referred to as "the Owner" and "The Owner") logs no information on you and has no interest in doing such, nor does Vigilcybre connect to the internet.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.

### COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
The Owner does not collect, transmit, distribute, or sell your data/information, personal or otherwise. The Owner doesn't have a database to collect anything in. 

All data entered and processed in the Vigilcybre app stays on your device and can be cleared by pressing "Clear User Data" when you go to the Vigilcybre app in Settings. 

Every time you completely restart the app, your previous data will not be saved.

### EMAIL
If you email the Owner for support or other feedback, the emails with email addresses will be retained for quality assurance purposes. The email addresses will be used only to reply to the concerns or suggestions raised and will never be used for any marketing purpose.

### DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
The Owner will not disclose your information to any third party except where required by law.

### CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY
The Owner may update the Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of 2023-07-01
